// In this kata we want to convert a string into an integer. The strings simply represent the numbers in words.

// Examples:

// "one" => 1
// "twenty" => 20
// "two hundred forty-six" => 246
// "seven hundred eighty-three thousand nine hundred and nineteen" => 783919
// Additional Notes:

// The minimum number is "zero" (inclusively)
// The maximum number, which must be supported is 1 million (inclusively)
// The "and" in e.g. "one hundred and twenty-four" is optional, in some cases it's present and in others it's not
// All tested numbers are valid, you don't need to validate them
