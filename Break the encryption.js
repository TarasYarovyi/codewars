// Task
// You are trying to create a function to decrypt an encrypted message. You have found out that the encryption is weak and simply rearranges the bits in the message.

// Quick Start
// You are to write a function decrypt(bitsString) taking a string of 0s and 1s representing bits in an encrypted message and returning a string of 0s and 1s with the bits in their original position.

// You have access to an encrypt(bitsString) function that will encrypt a message of your choosing.

// Input
// A string of 0s and 1s represending an encrypted message

// Output
// Return a string of 0s and 1s represending the decrypted message
//  -->

// // return the decrypted bits as a string
function decrypt(bitsString) {
  // you have access to an `encrypt(bits)` function that will encrypt
  // a message of your choosing represented by a string of 0s and 1s.
  // The encrypt() function will move the bits around in the same order for
  // every message of the same length and the decrypt() function should
  // return the bits to their original order
}
